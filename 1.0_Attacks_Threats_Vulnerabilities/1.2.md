## Malware

### Ransomware

* Malware that attempts to extort money from the user by holding the users data hostage behind an encryption key

> Example: A user downloads what they thing is a legitimate email attachment but the attachment executes a malicious script that encrypts all of the users data behind a secret key. A message would appear to the user explaining that they will get the secret key to unlock their data only after paying the attacker.

### Trojans

* Legitimate software that has been modified to include malicious code

> Example: A user downloads software from a third party hosting site rather than the original authors website. The software works as expected but the user has also unknowingly allowed a trojan to compromise their system.

### Worms

* Self-contained program that replicates itself and sends copies to other computers

> Example: A user downloads an infected email attachment that contains a worm. The worm can then modify or delete files or replicate itself to force the infected system to run out of resources

### Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP)

* Application that is installed onto a users system through unwanted means

> Example: A trojan could install a PUP such as an unwanted toolbar onto your web browser or redirecting to unwanted websites during internet searches.

### Fileless Virus

* This is a virus that does not need to be saved in order to infect a users system

> Example: One type of fileless virus could execute all of its code within the computers RAM. This would cause the user to become infected without receiving an antivirus notification or noticing any new malicious files being added to the system

### Command and Control (server)

* Provides overall command over an established botnet

> Example: A malicious actor can utilize a C&C center to synchronize tasks to be carried out by all machines within the botnet

### Bots

* Individual machines that compose a larger botnet

> Example: A users system is taken over by malware that incorporates the system into a bot net. This system can now be remotely accessed by the malware owner.

### Crypto Malware

* Malware that uses cryptography to encrypt a victims data

> Example: A users data is rendered unaccessible due to being encrypted. The data can only be decrypted when given the correct secret key.

### Logic Bombs

* Malicious program that only initializes after certain criteria are met

> Example: A user downloads a piece of software that works as intended. What the user does not know is that in a set amount of time, the logic bomb with detonate and unwanted behavior could compromise the users system
