# 1.3 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks

## Terms

---

### Privilege escalation

* Gaining access to a system and using that access to expand your foothold

> Example: A bad actor may gain access to a lower level employees credentials. These compromised credentials can then be used by the attacker to attempt to gain additional access to connected systems through vertical or horizontal escalation.

### Cross-site scripting

* An attack that exploits a vulnerable web page through malicious script injection

> Example: An attacker can use malicious javascript code to steal user ids from a vulnerable database or steal session cookies from individual users

### Injections

* An attack where malicious code is able to be injected into a data stream

> Example: An attacker can use a variety of different languages to perform injection.

* Structured query language (SQL)
* Dynamic-link library (DLL)
* Lightweight Directory
* Access Protocol (LDAP)
* Extensible Markup Language (XML)
